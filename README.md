## 📖 Overview
This project focuses on creating a fully responsive recipe page with semantic HTML and clean CSS. The challenge requires careful consideration of appropriate HTML elements for each section to ensure the content is structured and accessible. The final design should closely match the provided design mockup, while adhering to best practices for semantic coding.

It’s a great opportunity to practice:

- Writing semantic HTML that improves accessibility.
- Structuring content in a meaningful way using elements like <header>, <main>, <section>, <article>, and <footer>.
- Building responsive designs with CSS to ensure the page looks great on various screen sizes.

### 🔬 What I learned

This project helped me reinforce the importance of semantic HTML and the correct application of CSS styles to both ordered and unordered lists. I learned how to style the markers and the text separately, ensuring they each have distinct appearances while maintaining proper spacing for a clean and organized layout.
